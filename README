libLZR - A library to de- and encode LZR streams (as used in the Sony PSP firmware)

libLZR Version 0.11 by BenHur - http://www.psp-programming.com/benhur


-=Info=-

The library de- and encodes LZR streams (as used in the Sony PSP firmware).

Decompression results should be identical to Sonys internal decompression algorithm.
Please report incompatible streams to benhur(at)alpenjodel(dot)de.

Compression currently does not actually compress the data, but only produces a valid 
LZR stream. Future versions of this library might implement real compression.


-=Samples=-

There is currently no sample included due to the simple nature of this library.
A typical usage might be (out points to output array, in points to LZR stream):
int ret = LZRDecompress(out, out_capacity, in, NULL);


-=Dependencies=-

none


-=Changelog=-

0.11  - bug fixed where certain LZR streams were not decompressed correctly
      - potential bug fixed that could prevent correct decompression of certain LZR streams
      - initial public release

0.10  - initial release (not public)
